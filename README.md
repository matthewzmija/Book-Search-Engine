# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

The task at hand was to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Usage

The user is first faced with a landing page where they are able to search a term in the search box and results will appear. The user can then save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result. A user can view their saved books on a separate page and also have the ability to delete any saved books they no longer want. Keep in mind that these features are only available to a user once they have signed up or logged in.
